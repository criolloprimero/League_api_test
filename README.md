An exploratory analysis of data from the LOL API




## methodology

for this analysis I use the LOL API available at https://developer.riotgames.com/, since this is just exploratory this will not cover predictive analysis.  But just looking at the LOL api to learn about API's to sort and work with pandas array.

in order to find your own data for your champion you will need to make an account and request a API on this site, there is a quote on where to insert the code in the python script.  

hopefully to provide a useful analytics that can be considered for a current site to add to their service, and benifit the players


## results

so there are definitely sites that already take a look at players statistics, But I wanted to see if there were any charts that would be relevant for players to see and what information that could be gained. and what future analysis could compound on top of.  some data is repetitive as found on different sites.

I am using my own personal account for this analysis, I am a terrible player as much as I think I am good at the game :).  Mostly using simple charts, data manipulation and descriptive statistics.

# the Charts

First I decided to take a simple look at the list of champions that I played this season and the grabbed only the one that I had more than a 50% win rate. That is the first chart; I felt that this is left out of most sites. even though they post your best champs it does not filter out as simply the number of games played with the specified champs.

So as we can see in the second chart, a cut down version of the data that are just with champions that were played more than Five times.  and this was quiet lucky because it has done a good job of filtering my most used champs.  I would think that this level of analysis would be for optimization.
